## 2026-02-09 - Interactive Form Feedback Pattern
**Learning:** In marketing-heavy landing pages, providing immediate visual feedback during form submission (e.g., "Processing...") and a clear success state significantly improves perceived reliability and reduces double-submissions.
**Action:** Always implement `isSubmitting` and `isSuccess` states for lead generation forms, and use explicit `<label htmlFor={id}>` for maximum accessibility and click-target area.

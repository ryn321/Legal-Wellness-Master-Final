**Learning:** Adding a "Skip to content" link is a high-impact, low-effort accessibility improvement for keyboard users. Ensuring it is only visible on focus maintains visual design while providing utility. Active link indicators (route-aware styling) significantly improve navigation clarity.
**Action:** Always check for "Skip to content" links in root layouts and ensure primary navigation reflects the current page state.
